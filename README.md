#  On-Premise RAG Application for Industrial Use Cases

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an **On-Premise Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** tailored for industrial companies, including those in maintenance, manufacturing, and laboratory sectors. The application enables efficient utilization of technical documents such as manuals, maintenance reports, and regulatory standards without relying on cloud services, ensuring **data confidentiality** and **time-efficient retrieval of critical information**.

---

## Objectives
- **Index and query industrial documents** using an advanced RAG engine.  
- Enable **local consultation** of technical documents without cloud dependency.  
- Improve **document retrieval** and support **industrial decision-making**.  

---

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Functional Web Application**: An intuitive interface for users to interact with the RAG system.  
2. **RAG Engine**: Incorporates advanced ranking and NLP search algorithms for accurate and efficient document retrieval.  

---

## Key Features
- **On-Premise Solution**: Ensures data remains within the company's infrastructure.  
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Combines retrieval and generation for precise answers.  
- **Industrial Focus**: Optimized for technical documents like manuals, reports, and standards.  

---

## Added Value
- **Data Confidentiality**: All data stays on-premise, addressing security and compliance concerns.  
- **Time Savings**: Rapid access to critical information enhances operational efficiency.  

---

## Technologies and Skills
- **AI & Data Science**: NLP, retrieval algorithms, generative models.  
- **Software Engineering**: Web development, backend integration.  
- **Databases**: Efficient storage and retrieval of industrial documents.  

---

## Project Context
This project is proposed by **KABAS ENGINEERING** as part of the **ENSIA Group Project**, offering students the opportunity to work on innovative, industry-applicable solutions. Students are encouraged to complete an **internship with KABAS ENGINEERING** for proper supervision and access to resources, including:
